Original *3D Reconstruction from Multi-Date Satellite Images* online demo [here](https://gfacciol.github.io/IS18/).

This code extends the previous work by adding a Bundle Adjustment block to the pipeline.

The main tools to perform Bundle Adjustment and fit the corrected RPCs can be found in ```ba_utils.py``` and ```rpc_fit.py```.
